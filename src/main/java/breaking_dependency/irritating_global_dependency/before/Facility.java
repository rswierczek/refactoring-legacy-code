/**
 * The constructor uses a class named PermitRepository, and it needs to
 * be initialized with a particular set of permits to set up our tests properly.
 * We could get past this by parameterizing the constructor, but in this
 * application, this isnâ€™t an isolated case. There are 10 other classes that have
 * roughly the same line of code. It sits in constructors, regular methods, and
 * static methods. We can imagine spending a lot of time confronting this
 * problem in the code base.
